Description: GNU R package "Hyphenation and Syllable Counting for Text
 Analysis"
 .
 Provides the hyphenation algorithm used for 'TeX'/'LaTeX' and similar
 software, as proposed by Liang (1983, <https://tug.org/docs/liang/>).
 Mainly contains the function hyphen() to be used for
 hyphenation/syllable counting of text objects. It was originally
 developed for and part of the 'koRpus' package, but later released as
 a separate package so it's lighter to have this particular
 functionality available for other packages. Support for various
 languages needs be added on-the-fly or by plugin packages; this
 package does not include any language specific data. Due to some
 restrictions on CRAN, the full package sources are only available from
 the project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, request features,
 or discuss the development of the package, please subscribe to the
 koRpus-dev mailing list (<http://korpusml.reaktanz.de>).
