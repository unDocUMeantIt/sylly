Description: This is a native R implementation of the hyphenation
        algorithm used for 'TeX'/'LaTeX' and similar software, as
        proposed by Liang (1983). Mainly contains the function
        'hyphen()' to be used for hyphenation/syllable counting of text
        objects. It was originally developed for and part of the
        'koRpus' package, but later released as a separate package so
        it's lighter to have this particular functionality available
        for other packages. Support for various languages needs be
        added on-the-fly or by plugin packages, this package does not
        include any language specific data. Due to some restrictions on
        CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the
        project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, request
        features, or discuss the development of the package, please
        subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list
        (<http://korpusml.reaktanz.de>).
