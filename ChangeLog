ChangeLog for package sylly

changes in version 0.1-6 (2020-09-19)
fixed:
  - hyphen(): fixed the automatic adjustment of hyph.max.token.length that
    was introduced with 0.1-1 but turned out to be broken, at least with R 4.x
changed:
  - sylly:::kRp.hyphen.calc(): replaced a for loop with apply(), almost twice
    as fast now (without caching)
  - hyphen(): optimized processing speed, saves ~75% if your time now
  - describe(): the generic now provides the dots argument ("...") to allow
    adding further arguments by different methods

changes in version 0.1-5 (2018-07-29)
fixed:
  - sylly:::sylly_langpack(): removed obsolete 'flattr_user' attribute
changed:
  - session settings done with set.sylly.env() or queried by get.sylly.env()
    are no longer stored in an internal environment but the global .Options;
    this also allows for setting defaults in an .Rprofile file using options()
  - vignette is now in RMarkdown/HTML format; the SWeave/PDF version was
    dropped; it was also updated and has a new section on caching
  - sylly:::sylly_langpack(): updated the README.md template
  - sylly:::sylly_langpack(): removed "\dontrun{}" from generated example
    section
  - in the docs, improved the link format for classes, omitting the "-class"
    suffix
added:
  - new functions available.sylly.lang() and install.sylly.lang() to
    comfortably install language packages
  - new class object contructors kRp_hyphen() and kRp_hyph_pat() can be used
    instead of new("kRp.hyphen", ...) etc.

changes in version 0.1-4 (2018-01-06)
fixed:
  - set.hyph.support(): call optimize.hyph.pattern() on "kRp.hyph.pat" class
    objects to be added to the environment

changes in version 0.1-3 (2017-10-02)
changed:
  - added a short example to the code generated by sylly_langpack()
  - added l10n repository to DESCRIPTION to fetch now suggested language
    packages sylly.de, sylly.en, and sylly.es; it's clear now that language
    packages won't be released on CRAN, so a dedicated repo was set up to host those
  - updated the README.md file to mention releases both via CRAN (stable) and
    reaktanz.de (development)

changes in version 0.1-2 (2017-09-12)
changed:
  - first CRAN release
  - replaced status warnin in README.md with info on additional language
    support
  - manage.hyph.pat() no longer orders patterns, which was rather useless
added:
  - unit tests for all main functions and methods
removed:
  - file ChangeLog_hyph_patterns.txt

changes in version 0.1-1 (2017-06-10)
changed:
  - initial release
  - show(): method now only truncates the mid section of samples larger than
    15 words
  - all.patterns: this internal cache object is now dynamically generated
    when the package is loaded, which slows down the loading process but saves
    ~6.5MB in package size
  - hyph.max.token.length: this object was moved into the internal .sylly.env
    environment and also defaults to max token length of 50, not 200; that
    should be enough, is much faster and can also be changed dynamically (see
    set.sylly.env() below); manual changes shouldn't be needed, though, because
    the length is being adjusted automatically if needed; it was also renamed
    from hyph.max.word.length
added:
  - sylly_langpack(): a private method to generate packages with additional
    language support. it shouldn't be needed by regular users and is therefore
    not exported
  - koRpus2sylly(): a private function to convert old koRpus object files
    into sylly equivalents
  - hyphen(): new option "as" to set the return value class, still defaults
    to "kRp.hyph", but can also be "data.frame" or "numeric"
  - new shortcut methods hyphen_df() and hyphen_c() use different defaults
    for "as"
  - read.hyph.pat(): now also reads from connections, e.g., url()
  - set.sylly.env(): now also supports "hyph.max.token.length" as an option
    to manually set the maximum token length, affects the private object
    "all.patterns" (will be regenerated)
removed:
  - all hyphenation patterns are now in their own package called syll.<lang>
