changes in version 0.1-1 (2017-06-09)
changed:
  - initial release
  - show(): method now only truncates the mid section of samples larger than
    15 words
added:
  - sylly_langpack(): a private method to generate packages with additional
    language support. it shouldn't be needed by regular users and is therefore
    not exported
  - koRpus2sylly(): a private function to convert old koRpus object files
    into sylly equivalents
  - hyphen(): new option "as" to set the return value class, still defaults
    to "kRp.hyph", but can also be "data.frame" or "numeric"
  - new shortcut methods hyphen_df() and hyphen_c() use different defaults
    for "as"
  - read.hyph.pat(): now also reads from connections, e.g., url()
removed:
  - all hyphenation patterns are now in their own package called syll.<lang>
