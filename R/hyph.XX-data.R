#' Hyphenation patterns
#' 
#' Hyphenation patterns for \code{hyphen()} in several languages. Replace \code{"XX"} with \code{"de"},
#' \code{"de.old"}, \code{"en"}, \code{"es"}, \code{"fr"}, \code{"it"}, \code{"en.us"}, or \code{"ru"}, respectively.
#' These data objects are not really intended to be used directly, but rather to be consulted by the hyphen() function without further user interaction.
#'
#' @format The \code{pattern} slot of each hyphenation pattern object has three colums:
#'    \describe{
#'      \item{\code{orig}}{The original pattern in patgen style format.}
#'      \item{\code{char}}{Only the character elements of the pattern which can be matched to parts of an actual word.}
#'      \item{\code{nums}}{A code of digits defining the possibility to split syllables at respective places in this pattern.}
#'    }
#'
#' @source The patterns (as they are present in the \code{"orig"} column described above) were originally provided by the LaTeX developers[1],
#' under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License[2]. Refer to Liang (1983) for a detailed explaination -- it's fascinating.
#' From these original patterns the values in the remaining columns were created (using \code{\link[sylly:read.hyph.pat]{read.hyph.pat}}).
#' 
#' Note: Some of the original patterns might have been altered before, too. This is because the use cases slightly differ between LaTeX
#' and this package. For accurate hyphenation in text processing it's important to not split words in wrong ways, rather than identifying
#' all possible split points. I therefore understand that in general these patterns might lead to slightly more conservative results.
#' This package, however, uses the same algorithm to count syllables, that is, it's more important to just get the right sum of syllables
#' in a word, and actually quite irrelevant (for the time being) which actual syllables were identified. That is, for this purpose even
#' completely wrong suggestions wouldn't do any harm, as long as the overall number is correct, whereas perfectly valid hyphenations would
#' be misleading if they are missing one or more possibilities. If any such changes to the patterns have been made, they are fully
#' documented in the file "ChangeLog_hyph_patterns.txt" in the sources for this package. The
#' unchanged original patterns can be found under [1].
