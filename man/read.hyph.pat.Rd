\title{Reading patgen-compatible hyphenation pattern files}
\usage{
read.hyph.pat(file, lang, fileEncoding = "UTF-8")
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A connection or character string with a valid path to a file with hyphenation patterns (one pattern per line).}

\item{lang}{A character string, usually two letters short,
      naming the language the patterns are meant to
be used with (e.g. "es" for Spanish).}

\item{fileEncoding}{A character string defining the character encoding of the file to be read. Unless
you have a really good reason to do otherwise,
      your pattern files should all be UTF-8 encoded.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link[sylly:kRp.hyph.pat-class]{kRp.hyph.pat-class}}.
}
\description{
This function reads hyphenation pattern files,
      to be used with \code{\link[sylly:hyphen]{hyphen}}.
}
\details{
Hyphenation patterns that can be used are available from CTAN[1]. But actually any file
with only the patterns themselves, one per line, should work.

The language designation is of no direct consequence here,
      but if the resulting pattern object is to be
used by other functions in this package or \code{koRpus},
      it should resamble the designation that's used for the
same language there.
