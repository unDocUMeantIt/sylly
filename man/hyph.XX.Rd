\title{Hyphenation patterns}
\format{The \code{pattern} slot of each hyphenation pattern object has three colums:
   \describe{
     \item{\code{orig}}{The original pattern in patgen style format.}
     \item{\code{char}}{Only the character elements of the pattern which can be matched to parts of an actual word.}
     \item{\code{nums}}{A code of digits defining the possibility to split syllables at respective places in this pattern.}
   }}
\source{
The patterns (as they are present in the \code{"orig"} column described above) were originally provided by the LaTeX developers[1],
under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License[2]. Refer to Liang (1983) for a detailed explaination -- it's fascinating.
From these original patterns the values in the remaining columns were created (using \code{\link[sylly:read.hyph.pat]{read.hyph.pat}}).

Note: Some of the original patterns might have been altered before,
      too. This is because the use cases slightly differ between LaTeX
and this package. For accurate hyphenation in text processing it's important to not split words in wrong ways,
      rather than identifying
all possible split points. I therefore understand that in general these patterns might lead to slightly more conservative results.
This package, however, uses the same algorithm to count syllables, that is,
      it's more important to just get the right sum of syllables
in a word,
      and actually quite irrelevant (for the time being) which actual syllables were identified. That is, for this purpose even
completely wrong suggestions wouldn't do any harm,
      as long as the overall number is correct, whereas perfectly valid hyphenations would
be misleading if they are missing one or more possibilities. If any such changes to the patterns have been made,
      they are fully
documented in the file "ChangeLog_hyph_patterns.txt" in the sources for this package. The
unchanged original patterns can be found under [1].

\description{
Hyphenation patterns for \code{hyphen()} in several languages. Replace \code{"XX"} with \code{"de"},
\code{"de.old"}, \code{"en"}, \code{"es"}, \code{"fr"}, \code{"it"}, \code{"en.us"},
      or \code{"ru"}, respectively.
These data objects are not really intended to be used directly,
      but rather to be consulted by the hyphen() function without further user interaction.
